T-Board-Atiny 25/45/85
======================

T-Board for use on Breadboard - Attiny 25/45/85

This is a series of boards to speed up development of your own standalone ATMega/ATTiny projects.  The T-Board houses the microprocessor, power-supply and FTDI interface, with a breadboard-compatible footprint.  This allows you to get up and running fast with the core ATMega/ATTiny "heart" of your project.

This board is based on the great Arduino concept, and is compatible with the Arduino IDE.  It differs in that it:
- allows you to switch between 3.3V and 5V
- allows you to select crystals for low-power applications
- fits snugly into a breadboard, keeping your project together


There are 2 sets of schematic:
- T-Board-45-85 Etch:	1-layer, for hand-etching.  No ICSP header
- T-Board-45-85 PCB:	2-layer, for production-house.  With ICSP header
